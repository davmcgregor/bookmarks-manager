## <a name="Task">The Task</a>

You're going to build a bookmark manager. A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of bookmarks (URLs). You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse bookmarks other users have added. You can comment on the bookmarks.

This challenge is the fourth pair programming challenge at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy).

## <a name="Installation">Installation Instructions</a>


1. Fork this repository, clone to your local machine then change into the directory:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:davmcgregor/bookmakr-manager.git
$ cd bookmark-challenge
```
2. Load dependencies with bundle:
```
$ gem install bundle
$ bundle
```
3. Run Rspec for tests and coverage, then rubocop for linting
```
$ rspec
$ rubocop
```
4. Run the app on a local server and play on the broswer: http://localhost:4567/

```Shell
$ rackup config.ru -p 4567
```

## <a name="Database">Database setup</a>

1. Connect to psql
2. Create databases using the psql command CREATE DATABASE for `bookmark_manager` and `bookmark_manager_test`;
3. Connect to the databases using the pqsl command \c bookmark_manager;
4. Run the SQL scripts saved in the `db/migrations` folder in the given order;

Note: To set up the testing environment, create a test database and run the psql commands for both databases.
